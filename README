SimplySearchable
================

SimplySearchable adds very basic search functionality to ActiveRecord models. It is especially useful if you need to search relatively small collections of data that it doesn't make sense to index, such as product names.

Example
=======

In an ActiveRecord model:

class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
	simply_searchable :title => :name, :summary => :description
end

This will add the simple_search class method to your model:

Product.simple_search(terms, :conditions => "active = TRUE")


The second argument accepts an options hash which will be passed on to
Product.find()

NOTE:
Currently, the :conditions parameter only accepts a string. This means that
it is dangerous to pass user-submitted data to the conditions hash because it
is not being cleaned like it is when you do the following:
find(:all, :conditions => ["name = ?", params[:name]])

Therefore, only hard-coded conditions should be passed in this parameter.
